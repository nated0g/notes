Currently my `dot` repository using hard links to link in all of the dotfiles.  Today I come across an article outlining a better approach. https://guinuxbr.com/en/posts/backup-and-restore-dot-files/ 

I think I will set things up this way before setting up my desktop (currently only using WSL on my laptop, but am going to switch to desktop as my daily driver shortly.)
