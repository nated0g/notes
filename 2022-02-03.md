### **Different Go project**
#### 13:31:47
Yesterday I said I wanted to write a Go project that did MQTT to modbus conversion... maybe I can think of something that is more useful to me than that.  Going forward I'll be relying less on Modbus, certainly once I get the new hardware out it will only be used between a RoomController and a SensorNode.

I'll keep thinking about some other utility I could write that would be more useful to me.

What about a script that processes an Automation Direct tag file and auto assigns Modbus addresses?  Maybe it could also generate a JSON file with MQTT topics generated based on UDS structure format.  It would also need to include a datatype.  So maybe like:

``` 
{ 
	"topic": "R1/AC(1)/Cool1/Hyst/Setpoint",
	"address": 4037,
	"mbType": "holding",
	"type": "F32"
}
```

That could be ingested easily from either Node-red or whatever frontend I end up writing.  This would definitely make stuff more maintainable, and also would probably be useful for others.

From there it would also be pretty trivial I think to write the conversion part.  The hardest part is generating that list.

Ok so maybe I do still want to do the conversion part, haha.

We'll see.  Plenty of other stuff to work on.
