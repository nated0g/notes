### **Go project idea**
#### 21:43:48
I have an idea for a good project in Go.

The project will be a Modbus -> MQTT bridge.

Today I made a couple docker containers that run `pymodbus` that will be helpful for testing the Modbus side of things.  

### **TODO: change note script**
#### 21:47:36

I should change the note script to commit changes every time but prompt to push to github.  (Or maybe two prompts?)
