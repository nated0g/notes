### **I love this shit**
#### 21:46:31

Sometimes I can get overwhelmed by all the work I have to do.  But then, I remember:  I love this shit.  I've been doing it a long time and I really enjoy it.  I started learning HTML 20 years ago, back when we used tables to do all the layout.  Time to pour everything I have into this.

The approach will be: get caught up on homework for the 100devs stuff, and then work on whatever else I want (docker, k8s, go, whatever.)
