# Notes

This is a repository of notes I take while I am working/tinkering.  This was inspired by [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob)'s method of Zettelkasten using a script.  I wrote my own `bash` script to do it though, you can find it here: [nated0g/dot/scripts/note ](https://github.com/nated0g/dot/blob/master/scripts/note).

The script assume that the ~/notes directory is already setup as a git repository with an upstream to push to.
