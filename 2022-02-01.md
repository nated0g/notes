### **Vim/Tmux colour issues**
#### 11:02:18

I recently switched from the Ayu colorscheme to Nord, and was having an issue where the colours looked wrong when I was using vim from inside tmux.  I found lots of instances of this happening to other people online, but none of their solutions worked for me.  In the end, the issue was that with the Ayu theme I had added `set termguicolors` which affected the Nord theme in a bad way.  Solution was to comment out that line while using this theme.
