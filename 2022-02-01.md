### **Vim/Tmux colour issues**
#### 11:02:18

I recently switched from the Ayu colorscheme to Nord, and was having an issue where the colours looked wrong when I was using vim from inside tmux.  I found lots of instances of this happening to other people online, but none of their solutions worked for me.  In the end, the issue was that with the Ayu theme I had added `set termguicolors` which affected the Nord theme in a bad way.  Solution was to comment out that line while using this theme.

### **Added commit? prompt to notes script**

Instead of taking command line arguments other than a note title, I added a prompt at the end of my script to decide whether I want to make a commit or not.  Testing it now.

### **Tailwind**
#### 21:53:38

I checked out a project called [Tailwind CSS](www.tailwindcss.com) that looks really cool.  Here is a good article that the creator of the project, Adam Wathan, wrote: [Css Utility Classes and Seperation of Concerns](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/)

He raises some very good points.  Conventional wisdom is that we should keep CSS class names strictly semantic, but he makes a good argument for why not to do that.  The number one reason is this sort of CSS ends up being very difficult to maintain, and also very difficult to reuse.
