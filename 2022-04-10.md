### **Protobufs for NVS storage on ESP32**
#### 21:50:55
It's time for me to start experimenting with protocol buffers on microcontrollers.  Not only would it simplify passing structured messages, it could also be used as an efficient data storage format on the device.  I could use the same functions for deserializing that are used for receiving data from the network.

Instead of dealing with a bunch of seperate variables stored in NVS (Non-Volatile Storage), we would store the data as a binary blob, and read the entire data whenever we want any of it.  This way it would already be populated into a struct.
