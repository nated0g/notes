### **SCIM**
#### 10:48:03
I just found out about a terminal based spreadsheet program modelled after `vim` called `scim`.  **So cool!** definitely going to try it out.

### **1MB club**
#### 11:40:19
[1MB Club](https://1mb.club) is a list of sites under 1mb, there are a bunch of sites here that could work well in text based browsers like `w3m` and `lynx`

### **k8s@home**
#### 12:32:01
Awesome Kubernetes resource: https://github.com/k8s-at-home/

### **kodekloud**
#### 13:37:42
[KodeKloud](kodekloud.com) is a learning resource for DevOps/Kubernetes, should look into it more.

I should come up with a more definite plan for the sort of jobs I am interested in getting.  I am definitely going to finish the webdev stuff I have been working on, but ultimately DevOps/Cloud Native stuff seems like the direction I am most interested in pursuing right now.  It could change.  We'll see. 

Right now I am in a stage of absorbing as much information as possible and seeing where I end up.

I should set a reasonable budget for online learning resources also.

### **Ideas for notes script**
#### 13:44:54
I should add some sort of action that will automatically archive notes into months or something.

Also, I could add a `git pull` command at the beginning of the script to make sure that I have the same repo across devices.
