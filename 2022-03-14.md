### **docker-compose .env file**
#### 23:26:46

I just spent a solid hour trying to debug why my environment variables weren't getting passed in to a container when using docker-compose.  Apparently `docker compose up` will run just fine from a subdirectory below the one where the `docker-compose.yml` file is, but it will look for the `.env` file in your **current** directory, not the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.  Well, live and learn.  Now I'll remember to keep a terminal in the base level of the project all the time.:wq
