### **Project idea**
#### 22:04:25

Embedded development cluster featuring a testing pipeline, and device emulation

Imagine being able to spin up a bunch of ESP32s or the like and an MQTT broker.

It should be reasonably doable since there are already docker images for qemu on the esp32.

### **First steps**

First steps for that project would be a docker container with qemu running a basic MQTT test firmware on an emulated device, connecting to an MQTT broker service, and maybe a simple frontend.

Later the container orchestration stuff would come in (I'm definitely not ready for that yet) and we would be able to spin up multiple emulated microcontrollers, and network them.

In the end you could use it as part of an integration testing stage of the delivery pipeline.

Eventually this could possibly be configured from a YAML file, similar to a Dockerfile.  Possibly this sort of configuration can already use existing kubernetes tools.  

This would make for a much easier way to define integration tests.  You could set up all the devices and the app and everything all in one place and spin it up and run tests and possibly even have connections later on to hardware for flashing devices.


### **espressif qemu docker image**

Brian Ignacio works on the vscode extension for the esp-idf.  Very cool stuff, even if I don't use VS Code anymore.  Still creating some very useful stuff.

Here's a gist that includes how to setup Qemu in a docker container through vs-code.  There is definitely some information in there that is useful to me.
