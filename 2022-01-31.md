### **First entry to notes**
#### 10:41:27

Just testing.

### **Another entry to notes**
#### 10:42:32

Here I'm testing out a note taking `bash` script.

### **Future ideas for note script**
#### 10:50:32

I think the next thing I need to do is have a way to pass an argument to the `note` script that allows me to control wether or not it automatically pushes to this repo. Also I probably need to add some logic to pull from the repo for when I inevitably want to run this script from another machine.

### **testing a new entry**
#### 13:10:48

Sweet
