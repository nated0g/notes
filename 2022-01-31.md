Well, I had an idea when I started writing the alias that created this note,
but now I seem to have forgotten what it was.  Anyway, I took the idea for 
starting to keep regular notes on here from [rwxrob](https://www.github.com/rwxrob).

Anyway, I created an alias, `note` in my `.zshrc` that opens a markdown file in vim
labelled for the date that it is created.

This file was created with that alias.  I think the next step is to make it a seperate
bash script that takes in arguments and pipes them to vim, maybe auto populating the date
and taking a title or something.
